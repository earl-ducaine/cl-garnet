;;;; constraints.lisp
;;;  Changes:

;;;; kr-macros.lisp
;;;  Changes:
;;   eliminate ugly (g-value-inherit-values schema slot T nil)
;;                  (setf entry (slot-accessor schema slot))
;;             from gv-value-fn (in constraints.lisp)
;;   Merge formulas with structure slots.
;;   reuse directory-slot for formulas.
;;   reuse discarded slot structures in set-slot-accessor
;;   reuse discarded slot structures in clear-schema-slots


;;;; kr.lisp
;;;  Changes:
;;   RGA 3/28/95 --- Changed return values for s-value and g-value when
;;   type error occurs.  s-value now returns two values, the current
;;   value of the slot and t if an error occured during processing and
;;   nil if not.
;;
;;; TO DO:
;;
;; - *setting-formula-p* - does this still make sense???
;;
;; - check out direct dependency stuff (in DESTROY-CONSTRAINT).  Is it still
;;   needed?
;;
;; - put inverse on slot keyword itself?
;; - code in DELETE-SCHEMA for a formula: what to do with children formulas?
;;
