;;; Changes:
;;  09-Jun-94 Mickish - Called ccl:validate-view for Mac
;;  05-Mar-94 Mickish - Wrapped with-focused-view-or-gworld for Mac around
;;                      all drawing
;;  10-Aug-93 Koz/Mickish - Moved :set-frr-bbox and :set-styles methods to
;;                          fast-redraw.lisp; Created some sub-functions for update
;;                          method, since Allegro 4.1 couldn't handle large function.
;;  28-May-93 Mickish - Moved all total-p calculations to top of :update method
;;  17-May-93 koz Do not update children if only due to expose event
;;                (change suggested by bolt@cs.utk.edu)
;;  16-May-93 Mickish - Called :fix-update-slots method on all view-objects
;;                      during total-update.
;;   6-Apr-93 koz And omitted "clip-mask" as argument to update,
;;                and instead just set clip-mask at top level.
;;  27-Mar-93 koz Eliminated "flet" due to Allegro space leak.  Instead,
;;                now use "dothings" (defined in opal:macros.lisp), which
;;                is only a little clunkier...
;;  24-Mar-93 koz Changed code labeled "Recursively update children" so if
;;                it finds a child whose parent does not match the current
;;                window, it properly updates the re-parented child
;;   3-Feb-93 koz Reworked handling of fastdraws to now use invalid-*-fastdraws
;;                lists (see "flet" of "pre-process-fastdraws"...)
;;   3-Feb-93 koz Removed "last-invalid-obj" references.  Replaced calls to
;;                "free-invalid-objects" with "free-list".
;;   8-Jan-92 Mickish - Added reset of :in-progress quarantine slot
;;   6-Oct-92 koz Added code to handle invalid-view-objects, which lets you
;;                have :update-slots in view-objects (like AggreLists, etc.)
;;                and if they are invalidated, their :fix-update-slots method
;;                is invoked and is allowed to have side-effects!
;;  28-Sep-92 dzg,amickish - Added update-start-fn and update-stop-fn calls
;;  25-Sep-92 koz,amickish,hopkins  Only clear the window's invalid-objects
;;                 list (at beginning of update) if the window is visible.
;;  17-Sep-92 Mickish - When checking whether :width and :height of window
;;                      has really changed, ignore whether computed by formula.
;;  15-Jul-92 koz,dzg - Modified the :update method for windows to set the
;;		        list of invalid objects to NIL at the very beginning, to
;; 		        allow for reentrant invalidation by other processes (such
;; 		        as calling destroy-constraint from inside a formula during
;; 		        Update).
;;  28-Apr-92 williams Don't do total update on subwindow if only cursor
;; 		       changed.
;;  16-Apr-92 ecp Call xlib:display-force-output if any slots are invalid.
;;   9-Apr-92 ecp Removed patches of 4-Oct-91 from inner loop of update method.
;;  01-Apr-92 koz & Mickish Added a check in (**) loop for fast redraw objects
;;                          which handles the case when the parent has never
;;                          been updated
;;  31-Mar-92 ecp Fixed yet another bug: changing position of subwindow.
;;  26-Mar-92 koz Fixed method for propagating changes to the bboxes of
;;                fastdraws' parent(s) so it is once again constant-time,
;;                except for one special case.  See comments in code.
;;                (Also added "swap" macro, to swap two variables.)
;;  25-Mar-92 Mickish Get-Values ---> G-Value; added THE type declarations
;;  19-Mar-92 Mickish Added type declarations in set-styles methods
;;  11-Mar-92 Pervin  New width and height fields of win-update-info.
;;  28-Feb-92 ecp If width or height of window are invalidated,
;; 		  make sure that the value has really changed.
;;  28-Feb-92 amickish kr::schema-slots --> schema-p
;;  25-Feb-92 ecp Don't invalidate bboxes until very end.
;;  19-Feb-92 ecp Implemented double-clip-masks as list of length 8.
;;  16-Dec-91 ecp Rewrote exposure of double-buffered window.  No longer
;; 		  re-allocate exposed-clip-mask.
;;  11-Dec-91 ecp Removed change of 18-Oct-91.  It was expensive, and
;; 		  apparantly Kosbie's changes of Nov-91 made them unnecessary.
;;  25-Nov-91 koz significant restructuring of the code to reduce the amount
;;                of overhead when there are no changes to be made (this is
;;                to speed up "update-all")
;;  25-Nov-91 koz rewrote fix-properties-and-validate invocation code so now
;;                it skips the macro call, and then makes a function call to
;;                fix-window-properties (instead of the old method invocation)
;;  20-Nov-91 Kosbie & Pervin
;; 		  Fixed flicker in backing-store windows.
;; 		  Also, removed all #+comment parts, since they are never used.
;;  18-Oct-91 ECP Remove :width or :height from invalid-slots list of a
;; 		  window if the values of those slots hadn't actually changed.
;;   4-Oct-91 ECP Patches for virtual aggregates (e.g. changed-bbox).
;;   3-Oct-91 Andrew Mickish
;;                Changed fast-redraw code so that :fast-redraw-p now takes
;;                the values T, :rectangle, and :redraw
;;   5-Feb-91 Dave Kosbie & Andrew Mickish
;; 		  Changed first UNLESS clause in :update method to fix bug
;;                in placement of subwindows.
;;  28-Sep-90 ECP After drawing a fastdraw object, update the bboxes of
;;                its ancestors
;;  23-Aug-90 ECP Added two lines to :update to activate invalidate-demons
;; 		  associated with :width and :height
;;  13-Aug-90 ECP Changed g-value to get-local-value in test to see
;; 		  if window already has a :drawable.
;;  18-Jul-90 ECP Fixed bug with resizing double-buffered window.
;;   9-Jul-90 ECP Added test for kr::schema-name of invalid objects.
;;   2-Jul-90 ECP If an expose event occurs, just refresh the parts
;; 		  of the window that were exposed.
;;  20-Jun-90 ECP Lots of debugging of double-buffering.  If you
;; 		  de-iconify such a window and no other changes
;; 		  have taken place, just do a copy-area.
;;   6-Jun-90 ECP Implemented double-buffering.



;;; comment ** (this refers to where '**' appears in the code below): this line
;; is necessary because: if object A's visibility depends on its parent P,
;; which is in window W, and we set P's visibility from
;; T to NIL, and then we do a total update on W, so it traverses P,
;; sees that it's not visible, and stops there.  This will put up the correct
;; picture, but...  The visibility of P is *valid* and NIL, and the visibility
;; of A is *invalid*.  Then, we set P's visibility to T.  This does not put
;; P on W's invalid-objects list because aggregates have no 'interesting'
;; slots; nor does it put A there, since its visibility slot was already
;; invalid!!!  Thus, there is no record that A is now visible (though invalid),
;; and nothing happens on subsequent updates.
;; The fix:  in a total update, get the visibility slot of all invalid objects
;; (via g-value).  Why does this work?  Because, in the previous example, A's
;; visible slot would NOT be invalid when we set P to visible, thus resulting
;; in A's visible slot being invalidated, so A would wind up on the
;; invalid-objects list.
;; Note that there's a little more to it, since you have to also *record* that
;; A was invalid in the :update-slots-values array (aref ... 0), and in the
;; valid-p entry of the old-bbox in the :update-info of A.  Ack!
