Change log:
    05/25/94 Andrew Mickish - New Mac and X versions of draw-gesture-line
    04/04/94 James Landay - added a :line-style slot for gesture trace
    04/04/94 James Landay - use gem stuff to draw instead of xlib and mac --
                            also reset clip region in start-action
    04/02/94 James Landay - changed :xwindow slot to :drawable
    04/02/94 James Landay - added a new slot to the interactor, :erase.
                            Don't erase the gesture trace if :erase is true
    04/01/94 James Landay - don't use XOR -- instead invalidate and update
                            bbox of gesture (so works on Mac also)
    03/16/94 Andrew Mickish - #@(x y) ---> (ccl:make-point x y) because
               Allegro parses it anyway, even though it's in a #+apple switch?!
    02/16/94 Andrew Mickish - Fixed graphics routines for Mac
    06/15/93 James Landay - use HP-XOR-Hack instead of explicit xor handling
    04/03/92 James Landay - don't erase a point passed to stop-action,
                            since we never draw this point.
    02/19/92 James Landay - added gesture-fix-gc () to the
                            opal::*auxilliary-reconnect-routines* so
                            that if user switches monitors, get a new gc
    02/13/92 James Landay - special case for color monitors
                            to make xor drawing work properly
    01/31/92 James Landay - moved all export declarations
                            for gestures here.

Change log:
    07/02/93 James Landay - since fix-classifier () is unimplemented,
                            made it return the same error as when there
                            aren't enough examples.
    05/26/92 James Landay - added gest-remove-example ()
    03/24/92 James Landay - allow gestures with less than 3 points
                            in gest-add-example ()
    03/23/92 James Landay - made gest-done-adding () return nil on errors
    12/31/92 James Landay - changed function names
    12/27/92 James Landay - made add-example () and train-classifier ()
                            expect each example as an array rather than list
