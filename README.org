Mostly functional (currently only SBCL) complete (c. 1990) gui toolkit


* Garnet is a Graphical User Interface Toolkit

  It has a long storied history and has been dormant (exept for minor
  bug fixes to track the latest releases of various Lisps) for many
  years.  An overview of it's history can be found on [[http://www.cliki.net/garnet][Cliki]]

  Yet it is a mostly functional and suprisingly complete graphical
  user interface toolkit, and it remains one of only a few pure CL GUI
  Toolkits fully open source.

** Dependancies/requirements

   Currently the project is going through a massive code cleanup.
   Practically all feature specifications are out of date by decades,
   so I'm targetting a minimal, modern, convenient platform: Ubuntu
   16.04/SBCL 1.3.1.debian and Ubuntu 16.04/CCL1.11.5.  Other somewhat
   modern versions of Ubuntu and SBCL CCL are likely to work.  Other
   GNU/Linux distributions are also likely to work.  Mac and Windows
   probably won't. If a lisp has a working modern CLX, there's a good
   chance that it will run. Support for other OSs is definitely
   envisioned.  You may also need additional xfont libraries loaded,
   e.g.  you're using Ubuntu
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     apt-get install xfonts-100dpi
   #+END_SRC


** Installing/Running

   The easiest way to install and run the demo apps is:

   1) Make sure you have [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/#installation][Quicklisp]] installed.
   2) Clone the Garnet repo to a convenient location:

      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        git clone https://github.com/earl-ducaine/cl-garnet ~/garnet
      #+END_SRC

   3) Make sure your Lisp isn't running, then create a symbolic link
      in Quicklisp's local-projects folder and delete Quicklisp's
      system index. (to force it to re-search directories)

      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
        cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
        ln -s ~/garnet .
        rm ~/quicklisp/local-projects/system-index.txt
      #+END_SRC

   4) You should now be able to load the repo and all its dependancies
      via Quicklisp, and run the demo or begin using the library.

      #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
        (ql:quickload  :xoanon.gui.garnet)
        (demos-controller::do-go)
      #+END_SRC

   Note that ASDF integration is not quite working flawlessly.  So,
   you'll find it difficult to reload the library more than once into
   a single lisp session.  Also, sometimes it's necessary to delete
   your ASDF cache.  Something like the following: 

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     rm -rf ~/.cache/common-lisp
   #+END_SRC

   Or one of the sub folders.  But I like rebuilding everything from
   time to time.

** CCL and CLX

   CCL is particular about which version of CLX it runs.  The easiest
   way to ensure CLX compatibility is to download the complient
   version from the CCL Website and install it someplace that ASDF
   knows about, for example

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash

     mkdir ~/ccl-clx
     cd  ~/ccl-clx
     wget ftp://clozure.com/pub/CLX/clx-060601.tar.gz
     tar xf clx-060601.tar.gz
     echo '(push #p"/home/stallman/ccl-clx/clx_0.7.3-openmcl-060101/" ' \
	  'asdf:*central-registry*)' >> ~/.ccl-init.lisp 
   #+END_SRC

   After that you should be able to set up the Garnet repo for
   quicklisp in the same way as above.


** Documentation

   Garnet's documentation is extensive, but it was originally written
   in Scribe.  There is currently a scribe c library which converts
   scribe documents to tex, but it's not fully integrated yet.  So, no
   updates can be made to the Garnet documentation until that
   integartion is finished.  Still the documentation is quite useful,
   with good examples and an introductory tutorial.  What is out of
   date is the initial process of loading Garnet, which predates the
   advent of ASDF.
